# TLDR
This is a software library / plug-in that enables fast modelling of curvy and twisty glulam beams in Rhino3D. It is developed in C# using the RhinoCommon API and exposed as a set of Grasshopper components.

# Description
A constrained glulam blank model and associated models for the modelling of free-form glulam components. The focus is on providing a lightweight but informative method for quickly modelling complex glulam structures while respecting fabrication constraints such as lamella sizing in relation to curvature. The model helps calculate material specifications, creates driving geometry for cutting joints, offers different types of glulam blanks (straight, single-curved, and double-curved), and several options for how the glulam cross-section is oriented along its centreline curve. Additional models link individual glulam components with graph-based methods of managing entire structures and connections.
